We recommend you enable this flag, as it will become the default in a future major release. Learn more about the various compiler options supported in Angular.</p>\n<h4>Support for TypeScript 2.6</h4>\n<p>Angular now supports TypeScript 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6. Check out some of the new features in TypeScript 2.6.</p>\n<h4>Improved Router Param & Data Inheritance</h4>\n<p>Previously, nested routes would only inherit parameters and data from parent routes if the parent route did not have a component set. Now paramsInheritanceStrategy can be set to always, meaning child routes will have access to all ancestor parameters and data.</p>",
